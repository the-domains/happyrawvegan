An allergic reaction to a vaccine turned me from a healthybaby into a very sick one.Thisled to 20 years of disabilityand ill health, until I discovered the raw vegan diet as ayoungadult.

I was born perfectly healthy but an allergic reaction to alive polio vaccine at the age of10months almost killed meand left me with convulsions, seizures and paralysis. Atthattime doctors did not have to report such reactions, sothey treated my condition assymptoms of flu and fever anddosed me up with antibiotics.
